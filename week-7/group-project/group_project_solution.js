// Ok, I'm going to do my best to follow the instructions and write my user stories without using any code language at all, although the instructions do say that I can use the name of the functions that the tests intend for us to write.  Here it goes:


// Function name 'sum':  As a user, I want a way to add up a bunch of numbers.  The bunch of numbers could be any quantity of numbers.

// Function name 'mean':  As a user, I want a way to find the average of a bunch of numbers.  The bunch of numbers could be any quantity of numbers.

// Function name 'median':  As a user, I want a way to find the median of a bunch of numbers.  The bunch of numbers could be any quantity of numbers.
