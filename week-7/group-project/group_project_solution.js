// Group 12
// Person 1: Jim O'Neal

// Ok, I'm going to do my best to follow the instructions and write my user
// stories without using any code language at all, although the instructions
// do say that I can use the name of the functions that the tests intend for
// us to write.  Here it goes:

// As a user, I want to perform three different mathematical operations on a
// list of numbers.  The list of numbers could be any quantity of numbers.  The
// three things are three separate operations and don't need to be done all at
// once.  I just want to be able to use whichever operation I want on any list
// of numbers.  The three things I want to be able to do are:
// 1) I want to add up (sum) the list of numbers.
// 2) I want to find the average (mean) of the list of numbers.
// 3) I want to find the middle value (median) of the list of numbers.
