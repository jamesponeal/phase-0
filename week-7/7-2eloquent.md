# Introduction

0.1 Did you learn anything new about JavaScript or programming in general?
Other than a summary of what is in the book, I learned some of the history behind JavaScript and some interesting history of programming.

0.2 Are there any concepts you feel uncomfortable with?
So far everything makes sense to me.


# Ch. 1: Values, Types, and Operators

1.1 Identify two similarities and two differences between JavaScript and Ruby syntax with regard to numbers, arithmetic, strings, booleans, and various operators.
Similarities:
1) Order of operations when conducting arithmetic operations.
2) 'Escaping' a character when writing strings.
Differences:
1) Semi-colons everywhere.
2) Paraenthesis around everything.


# Ch. 2: Program Structure (Links to an external site.)

2.1 What is an expression?
An expression is a fragment of code that produces a value.

2.2 What is the purpose of semicolons in JavaScript? Are they always required?
A semicolon signals the end of a statement or expression.  They are not always required, but the rules for when they are not required are complex.

2.3 What causes a variable to return undefined?
If you ask for the value of an empty variable.

2.4 What does console.log do and when would you use it? What Ruby method(s) is this similar to?
Console.log prints something to the terminal, similar to 'puts' in ruby.

2.5 Describe while and for loops
While and for loops are mechanisms for repeating certain actions multiple times.

2.6 What other similarities or differences between Ruby and JavaScript did you notice in this section?
The basic concepts of flow control and conditionals are the same, but the syntax is different.  JavaScript uses a lot of parenthesis and curly braces in situations that are not required in Ruby.


# Ch. 3: Functions (Links to an external site.) (Skip the sections on closure and recursion)

3.1 What are the differences between local and global variables in JavaScript?
Local variables are declared inside a function and are specific to that function.  Global variables are declared outside a function and are avaiable throughout the program.

3.2 When should you use functions?
When you have a specific task that part of the program needs to complete that can be neatly wrapped in a separate piece of code.  This enables this group of code to be called upon in different sections of the program.

3.3 What is a function declaration?
Function declaration is a way of defining a function in the following format:
function function_name(variable) {
  cool stuff with a variable;
}


# Ch. 4: Data Structures: Objects and Arrays (Links to an external site.)

4.1 What is the difference between using a dot and a bracket to look up a property? Ex. array.max vs array["max"]
Both are methods for accessing a property, the difference is how they are accessed.  The dot method directly names the property where the bracket method is evaluated to get the property name.

4.2 What is a JavaScript object with a name and value property similar to in Ruby?
A JavaScript object is similar to a hash in ruby.


# REFLECTION QUESTIONS:

What are the biggest similarities and differences between JavaScript and Ruby?
I think that the logic behind how things work together is very similar between the two languages.  However, much of the syntax is very different.

Was some of your Ruby knowledge solidified by learning another language? If so, which concepts?
I would say that some basic logic and concepts that I already had a good handle on were reinforced.  JavaScript so far wasn't difficult because the concepts are the same, I had some difficulty with syntax because I had semi-colon and curly brace craziness going on.

How do you feel about diving into JavaScript after reading these chapters?
So far I definitely like Ruby better because the syntax seems more programmer friendly, I'm looking forward to learning more only because I know JavaScript is a popular language and even if I work in a job where Ruby is the primary language, I know that I will still encounter JavaScript.
