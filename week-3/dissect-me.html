    <p>For this assignment we were instructed to choose a topic to research and then write about it. I chose to research the difference between margin, border, and padding.</p>

    <p>Basically the padding is what exists between the content of a block and the border, the margin is what exists between the border and the edge of the block, and the border is what is in the middle. All three of these things can be non-existent, or they can have a thickness which can be specified using two different methods. Borders and padding can have a background, but the margin is transparent and will show whatever background it overlaps.</p>

    <p>You can specify margin or padding on each side of the block individually, or all on one line as shown in the examples below. When the margin or padding is specified all on one line, the first number is the top and then rotates clockwise to right, bottom, and left.</p>

    <p>padding-top: 0px;<br>
    padding-right: 0px;<br>
    padding-bottom: 0px;<br>
    padding-left: 0px;<br>
    <br>
    padding: 0px 0px 0px 0px;</p>

    <p>If you want your entire block to take up a certain amount of space, the important thing to remember is that your border has a thickness, and the padding thickness extends to the inside edge of the border, and the margin thickness doesn't start until the outside edge of the border.</p>

    <p>Thanks for reading my blog, I hope you learned something about padding, border, and margin!</p>

This is my reflection for GPS 1.2: The Anatomy of HTML

In this guided pairing session, we created an HTML document, learned about the important sections of an html file, and different semantic html tags.  My pair and I created the html file you see above this comment.  For the content, I copied and pasted in some of the content from my 3.6: Technical Blog assignment that I had already completed.

In this exercise, we were also asked to answer the following questions:

1. What HTML5 tags have you used in this challenge and continue to return to often? Why?

In this challenge I used <html>, <head>, <title>, <body>, <main>, and <p>.  These are all common tags that I have been using since starting the HTML week of DevBootcamp.  Most of these tags are required for an html file to function, so I have returned to these tags because they are required.  Other tags such as <main> and <p> are common tags that I have been using.  I use the <main> tag to group my main content together and <p> tags to separate individual paragraphs.

2. How do elements get laid out on a page? What is the order the browser uses to display elements?

The browser displays the content in the order it is written in the html file, from beginning to end.

3. What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date? What about research some shortcuts that already exist?

Snippets was definitely a new thing that I learned during this challenge.  I will most likely use the html5 trigger that we created in this lesson when I create new html files in the future.  Another handy thing that our guide showed is how to comment and un-comment text by using "command-?".  That is something that I will definitely incorporate into my keyboard shortcut habits.
