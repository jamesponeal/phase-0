<!--
This is my reflection entry for 2.6, First HTML Page:

- What was it like to translate your previous learning with HTML into an actual site?
It was a great learning experience, and good to work with a pair to bounce ideas off of.

- How was it researching and using semantic HTML5 elements?
It was fairly easy, my pair and I both were fairly good at remembering how to do everything from our HTML exercises on Code Academy.  We did have to look up how to add a link to an image, which we googled and found an article on stack overflow.

- How did you do at keeping to best practices (i.e. no formatting in the HTML)
I think we did well.  We left out any styling tags and kept everything to the bare bones.

- What seems good and bad about HTML?
The good: you can concentrate on filling in content and worry about making it look pretty later.
The bad: you have to worry about making it look pretty later.  I am concerned that because of how we constructed things in our HTML, it might make the CSS section difficult, but we will have to wait and see.

- What tricks do you have for remembering how to write HTML?
I keep my own 'boilerplate' html file that I start from that already has the standard DOCTYPE, html, head, and body opening and closing tags.  From there it is just a matter of filling in content.
