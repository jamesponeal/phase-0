##This is my reflection entry for lesson 2.8 Your Website Part 2 (Solo Challenge)

For this lesson we were instructed to finish out our website which will, among other things, contain our blog.  This process was started by creating a sitemap and wireframes.  My sitemap and wireframe are located in the imgs folder on GitHub which is located at the link below.

My html files and other information is located in the repository located here:

###We were asked to answer the following questions in our reflection:

####How was your experience translating a wireframe into HTML?
I thought it was fairly straight forward, but the rendering of my HTML file does not quite look like the wireframe because I think I am going to need to use some CSS to get the positioning of things where I planned them on my wireframe.  CSS comes next week so I'm looking forward to that.

####What new tricks or elements did you learn about in HTML?
I learned about sizing photos.  I also learned more about using tags other than just "<div>".  I had never used <section>, <footer>, or <main> before starting bootcamp.

####Are you excited to start incorporating the design you chose next week?
I am excited to add better positioning, styling, and color to my site using CSS.
