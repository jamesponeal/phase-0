#1.1 Think About Time

I learned about time boxing, developing tiny habits, and growth vs fixed mindsets.  Time boxing is a time management tool where you set a specific amount of time for work, you focus all of your attention on your task for that amount of time, and then take a short break.  I have actually already been using this method on my own, but didn't have a name for it.  I feel that it works for me, so I will continue to use it.  I also plan on trying to develop some tiny habits through phase 0, such as getting up in the morning and working on assignments for 30 or 45 minutes before I get ready for anything else I have planned for the day.  My current work schedule changes week to week, so it's difficult to say there's a specific time of day that I will do my assignments.  My plan for time management is basically to look at the tasks I need to do for the week and set aside time around my work schedule to get them done.

#1.2 The Command Line

Hello, this is my reflection for assignment 1.2 (The Command Line)

A shell is an interface for a user to communicate with the operating system.  Bash is a common type of shell used to communicate with unix.

The most challenging parts of the command line lesson was fully understanding some of the redirection and 'exporting' of commands.  I think as I continue to gain experience using them, they will become easier and more intuitive.  Also, the "apropos" command didn't make much sense to me.

I was able to successfully use all of the commands using the lessons, and also successfully played with each command on my own.

It's difficult to say which commands are the most important since I am fairly new at using the command line.  Right now I want to say that basic navigation commands such as "pwd", "ls" and "cd" would be the most important, but I'm sure once I get deeper into programming, other commands will show themselves as the most important.

Some commands and what they do:
-pwd - print working directory
-ls - list files and directories
-mv - move a file or directory
-cd - change directories
-../ - parent directory (or "up" one directory)
-touch - creates a new file.
-mkdir - makes a new directory
-less - lets you look through a file
-rmdir - removes a directory
-rm - removes a file
-help - gives a list of commands

#1.4 Forking and Cloning

To create a new repository:
Go to your github account.
Click on the plus sign at the top of the page.
Type in the name you want for your repository, select public or private, add a license if needed, and click 'Create repository'.

To fork:
Go to the GitHub repository you want to fork.
In the upper right, click "Fork".

To clone:
Go to the GitHub repository you want to clone.
Copy the HTTPS clone URL from the window in the lower right corner.
Go to your command line and navigate the folder where you want the clone to exist.
Type "git clone" followed by the clone URL you copied in step 2.
You would fork a repository over creating a new one if you plan on working and collaborating on a code project that would be merged back to the code that you forked from.  Forking makes merging much easier.

I didn't have any real struggles setting up git on my machine, or getting my GitHub account set up.  The things I learned have just been learning the beginnings of what git and GitHub are and how to do what we have done so far in the lessons, but maybe more importantly is that I'm starting to understand what they are used for and what useful tools they are for programmers.  I had never used either before starting phase 0.
