Explain how to create a repository on GitHub and clone the repository to your local computer to a non-technical person.
Create a repository: Log in to your GitHub account, click on the plus sign in the upper right corner of the screen.  Name the repository, select public or private, and select licenses.  Click create repository.
Clone the repository: copy the clone URL on the lower right side of your new repository.  Go to your command line and type "git clone" followed by the URL you just copied.

Describe what open source means.
Open source code is code that is able to be freely distributed, and can be developed and modified collaboratively by users.

What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia?
I think open source is a good thing for improving things to make them more productive and useful.  It does not make me feel nervous or protective.

Assess the importance of using licenses.
Licenses are what give you the permission to use and make changes to open source software.  Not all licenses are the same, and some may not allow you to do certain things that others do allow.  It is important to know which license you are using and what you are allowed to do to avoid violating a license agreement.

What concepts were solidified in the challenge? Did you have any "aha" moments? What did you struggle with?
Getting more practice with creating and cloning a repository, and more practice with adding, committing, pushing, pulling, and merging helped solidify all of those concepts.

Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.
I thought this was a good description of licensing:
