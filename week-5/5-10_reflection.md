Hello classmates!  This is my entry for exercise 5.10: Cultural Discussion.

In this exercise, we were instructed to review the feedback we were given and the ratings on the feedback that we gave, and then answer the following questions.

 
Pairing:

1) What was it like to pair with others to solve challenges?
I really enjoyed it.  By feeding off of each other, sharing ideas, and sharing knowledge, I think that the pairing exercises can be extremely beneficial to learning.

2) What aspects of pairing were particularly fun or rewarding?
Sharing of knowlege and ideas is probably the most rewarding part.  It really makes it seem like I'm getting the most out of my education at DevBootcamp.  The most fun part is probably just getting to know people in my cohort.

3) What aspects of pairing were frustrating and difficult?
At times there have been some technical difficulties with pairing, but aside from that, I have a hard time with navigating because it makes me feel as if I am not contributing much, but I am aware of this and it's something I'm continuing to work on and get better at.



Feedback:

1) How did you feel when you read your feedback?
Overall it made me feel good. All of my feedback was good, even the criticisms were well worded.  I try to be a good pair so it was nice to hear my pairs give me good feeback.


2) Was the feedback you received helpful to your learning?
I think some of the suggestions that people have made will help me become a better pair partner, which will indirectly help my learning.


3) Based on the feedback you've received, what are you going to do to improve next time you pair?
I think one thing that was suggested that I will continue to do is timeboxing problems.  If my pair and I get stuck on something, we should timebox it and if we have not found a solution, we should move on and come back to it later.


4) How was it to write feedback? What can you do to improve your own feedback?
Overall, writing feedback for me is difficult.  I often have really good pairing sessions, so writing something that is specific and actionable can be difficult because typically I don't have any specific suggestions for anything that can be done differently in the future.  It's like the old saying: if it's not broken don't fix it.  To improve the feedback that I write, if there isn't anything that I think my pair should improve on, I can probably try to identify things that my pair did well and suggest that they ensure that they keep doing this.


5) What was most difficult for you when writing feedback for your pair?
As I mentioned in the previous question, writing something that is specific and actionable can be difficult because I typically have had really good experiences in my sessions, so it's hard to come up with specific suggestions for anything that can be done differently in the future.


6) Overall, what do you think of using pairing and feedback to guide your learning?
I think there is a lot of value in pairing.  I see the benefit in having someone to share ideas and knowledge with and how that benefits the learning process.  I also think the feedback is valuable as a way to improve communication and identify things I need improvement on.
